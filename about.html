					<p class="aboutText">Hi, my name is Michelle Watts; and I'm the lucky owner of Olive on Brooklea. I am often asked about myself and how the shop got started. My interest in delicious food, healthy diet, and cooking goes back a long way; but the year 2001 brought two significant events together that deepened those interests. In June 2001, I was diagnosed with breast cancer; and in August of 2001, my husband and I welcomed our first Newfoundland, Pearl, into our home. Pearl soon developed irritable bowel disease, so I began reading in depth about the ingredients in commercial dog food. The more I read about pet food and what is contained in it, the more I wanted to know about food sources in general.</p>

					<p class="aboutText">My diet had been a pretty good one, but I wanted it to be better. I figured I would do just about anything I could to avoid any more chemo, radiation, or visits to the oncologist! Diet and lifestyle are so important to good health. I certainly can't control my health completely, but I can support my body in every way possible to maintain good health. At the same time that I started making homemade meals for my animals, I made some big changes in my own meals. For instance, I cut out as much refined sugar, white flour, and processed foods as possible, while at the same time making the majority of my diet fresh vegetables and fruits.</p>

					<p class="aboutText">When my sister-in-law brought me to an olive oil and balsamic vinegar tasting store, it was a perfect fit. I could enhance the flavor of my food without adding things I didn't want, like sugar. Then one evening while I was washing the kitchen floor, my attention was drawn to an interview on the radio. The guest turned out to be Tom Mueller, author of Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil. Once I read his book, I was convinced that my family, friends, and community needed to have easy access to extra virgin olive oil that was as fresh as possible and truly what it purported to be. Olive oil, flavorful, versatile, and a good source of monounsaturated fat, has been a healthy diet staple since ancient times. Its popularity continues to the present day; and it's a major component of the Mediterranean diet, among many others.</p>

					<p class="aboutText">Mueller had already done a thorough investigation of extra virgin olive oil, so I contacted him to make sure my sourcing was trustworthy. I got the green light from him at about the same time that an inviting space opened up on Brooklea Drive. The next thing I knew, it was all coming together.<p>

					<p class="aboutText">I didn't feel that my shop would be complete without creations by some fabulous local artists and food artisans. It is my pleasure to offer these items in addition to the oils and balsamics.<p>

					<p class="aboutText">Olive on Brooklea is on a mission to bring you the world's freshest olive oils and the most delicious balsamic vinegars. Free tastings are offered daily by a friendly, knowledgeable staff that includes my husband and mother. I look forward to meeting you!</p>
